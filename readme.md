# ![UUs logotyp](./graphics/UU_logo_color.png "UU logotype") Graph Theory (1MA170), Fall 2023

Welcome to the course in graph theory at the bachelor's level at Uppsala University. For general information about the course - the exam, the handin, and lecture plan, [see this document](https://vagdur.github.io/Grafteori-1MA170/course-information.pdf).

# Other course material

1. In addition to the lecture notes, the book Graph Theory by Reinhard Diestel is listed as course literature, and it may be a useful reference. It ought be [available as a pdf from the university library](https://uub.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?tab=Everything&search_scope=MyInst_and_CI&vid=46LIBRIS_UUB:UUB&offset=0&lang=sv&query=isbn,contains,9783642142789).
2. The lecture notes from last year's edition of the course [are available here](https://vagdur.github.io/Grafteori-1MA170/lectureNotes2022.pdf). The material covered should be essentially the same, just in a slightly different style. These should be useful if you want to read ahead.

# Where to find a paper for the assignment

If you have some specific topic that came up during a lecture that you want to delve deeper into, I may be able to suggest something for you. Otherwise, you can have a look at what was published at some recent conferences in the area. Some of these conferences are about combinatorics more broadly, so not every paper in them will be suitable. One of them is about network science, so it is a good place to look for more applied papers.
