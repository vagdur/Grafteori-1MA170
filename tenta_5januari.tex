There are a total of ten questions on this exam. You are to \highlight[dark-orange]{\textbf{pick eight of them to answer}}.\sidenote[][]{If you answer more than eight questions, your exam total score will be the sum of your eight \emph{lowest} scores, so there is absolutely \textbf{no} benefit to answering more than eight questions.}

Good luck! {\vspace{0cm}\includegraphics[height=0.08\textwidth]{graphics/burning-heart-emoji.png} \includegraphics[height=0.08\textwidth]{graphics/lily-emoji.png}}

\section{Question 1 (5p)} % about L10

What does it mean for a graph to be $k$-connected? State a correct definition.

We proved a characterisation of two-connected graphs as being exactly the graphs that can be constructed by a certain process starting from a cycle graph. State the theorem, and give a proof of it.

\section{Question 2 (5p)} % about L4

Define the adjacency matrix $A$, incidence matrix $D$, and Laplacian matrix $Q$ of a graph. Prove that $Q = DD^t$.

\section{Question 3 (5p)} % about L7

Recall that Hall's marriage theorem gives a condition for the existence of a matching of one side of a bipartite graph into the other in terms of a condition on the size of sets $Q \subseteq A$ and their neighbour sets $N(Q) \subseteq B$.

Give a precise statement of the theorem, and then give a proof.\sidenote[][]{The proof we gave in the lecture was a clever application of the max-flow min-cut theorem, where we turned our bipartite graph into a flow network. If you choose to give this proof, please also draw a figure of the construction.}

\section{Question 4 (5p)} % about L6
\textbf{Part a:} Prove that if you remove $k$ edges from a tree $T$,\sidenote[][]{Where the tree has more than $k$ vertices, so there are indeed $k$ edges to remove.} the resulting graph is a forest of $k+1$ trees.
\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent
\textbf{Part b:} Pick one of Kruskal's or Prim's algorithms. State it and prove its correctness.

\section{Question 5 (5p)} % about L11

What does it mean for a graph to be planar? What is the planar dual of a planar graph? Give definitions, and include a correct figure illustrating the definition.

Prove the following result from the course:\sidenote[][]{Hint: Consider a spanning tree of $G$ and its complement in $G^*$.}
\begin{theorem}[Euler's formula]
  Let $G = (V,E)$ be a connected planar graph, and let $f$ be the number of faces for some planar embedding of $G$. Then
  $$\abs{V} - \abs{E} + f = 2,$$
  and so in particular any two planar embeddings have the same number of faces.
\end{theorem}

\section{Question 6 (5p)} % about L2
What does it mean for a graph to be Eulerian? State and prove Euler's theorem giving a criterion for a graph to be Eulerian.

\section{Question 7 (5p)} % about L14

Recall from the lectures that the \emph{minimum bisection problem} asks for a partition of the vertices of a graph into two equally-sized sets\sidenote[][]{So, as we state it, it only applies to graphs with an even number of vertices.} such that the number of edges between them is minimal.

We proved an upper bound on how many edges you could be forced to include in such a bisection using the probabilistic method, where we started by picking a matching on the complement graph. State and prove this result.

\section{Question 8 (5p)} % about L18

Given a graph $H$ and an integer $n$, define the extremal function $\ex(n; H)$ of $H$.

TurÃ¡ns theorem says that
$$\ex(n; K_{r+1}) \leq \left(1 - \frac{1}{r}\right)\frac{n^2}{2}.$$
Prove this.\sidenote[][-1cm]{We gave two proofs in the course, and there are many more pretty proofs floating around. Any correct proof is of course a correct answer to the question.

The first proof we gave in the course used the Caro-Wei result on independent sets, and then applied the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality
$$\abs{\langle a, b \rangle} \leq \norm{a}\norm{b}$$
to a clever choice of $a$ and $b$.}

\section{Question 9 (5p)} % surprise stuff!

A \emph{directed acyclic graph} (often called just a \emph{DAG}) is a directed graph that contains no cycles. Devise a reasonable\sidenote[][]{That is, not just a brute-force method, but something you'd actually use in practice.} algorithm for determining when such a graph is Hamiltonian. For directed graphs, being Hamiltonian means having a \emph{directed} Hamiltonian path.

\section{Question 10 (5p)} % surprise stuff!

For each of these statements, determine if it is true or false and give a proof or disproof:\sidenote[][]{Each statement gives one point, except for c) and d), which give half a point each.}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
  \item For every $k\geq 3$, there exists a $k$-regular Hamiltonian graph.
  \item For every $k \geq 1$, there exists a $k$-regular planar graph.
  \item For every $k \geq 1$, there exists a multigraph with exactly $k$ spanning trees.
  \item For every $k \geq 1$, there exists a graph with exactly $k$ spanning trees.
  \item There exists a $6$-connected planar graph.
  \item There exists a tree in which every vertex has degree $2$.
\end{enumerate}
